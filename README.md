# WasteClassifer
The Waste Classifier Project aims to develop a web-based application that allows users to classify different types of waste using a webcam. This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques, particularly with TensorFlow and Keras, to identify and categorize waste into various types. The application provides solutions for recyclable wastes, guiding users on how to handle them properly.

# Key Components
Frontend:
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For creating a user-friendly interface where users can capture images using their webcam and interact with the classification results.
Webcam Integration: JavaScript is used to capture images from the webcam, which are then sent to the backend for classification.

Backend:
Flask: A lightweight Python web framework that handles the communication between the frontend and the machine learning model.
Machine Learning Model: A convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify the captured images into different waste categories.

Image Processing:
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Used for preprocessing the captured images, ensuring they are in the correct format for the machine learning model.

# Future Enhancements
Expand the Model: Increase the accuracy of the model by training it with more diverse datasets.
User Feedback: Allow users to provide feedback on the classification accuracy, which can be used to improve the model.
Educational Resources: Provide users with more detailed information and resources on waste management and recycling practices.
Mobile Application: Develop a mobile version of the application for easier access and usage.
This project not only helps in classifying waste but also educates users on proper waste management and recycling practices, contributing to a cleaner environment.
